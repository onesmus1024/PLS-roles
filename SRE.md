## Site Reliability Engineer (SRE)

**Who They Are**  
A Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) is responsible for ensuring that software systems and applications are reliable, scalable, and perform optimally. They use software engineering practices to manage system reliability, focusing on minimizing downtime, automating manual processes, and addressing infrastructure challenges. SREs balance the need for high availability with the pace of new feature releases, working closely with development and operations teams.

### Key Responsibilities

- **System Reliability & Monitoring**  
  - Set up and configure monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog) to track application and infrastructure performance.
  - Establish and manage Service Level Indicators (SLIs) and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) to ensure that systems meet reliability targets.
  - Develop automated health checks and establish performance benchmarks for system health.

- **Incident Response & Root Cause Analysis**  
  - Develop and maintain incident response protocols to quickly troubleshoot and resolve system issues, minimizing downtime.
  - Conduct post-incident analyses (postmortems) to identify root causes and document lessons learned.
  - Implement preventive measures to mitigate recurring issues, continually refining response playbooks.

- **Performance Optimization & Capacity Planning**  
  - Analyze system performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies.
  - Implement performance optimizations and capacity planning strategies to ensure systems handle traffic spikes and scale as needed.
  - Regularly review infrastructure usage to improve cost efficiency while maintaining high performance standards.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Automation**  
  - Use Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes to manage infrastructure, ensuring consistent environments.
  - Automate deployment, scaling, and maintenance tasks to reduce manual effort and improve system reliability.
  - Collaborate with DevOps teams to integrate automation and IaC into CI/CD pipelines.

- **Security & Compliance**  
  - Implement and maintain security best practices across infrastructure, including network security, access control, and vulnerability management.
  - Ensure compliance with industry standards (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001) and regulatory requirements for data privacy and protection.
  - Conduct regular vulnerability assessments, applying patches and updates to maintain a secure environment.

- **Collaboration & Documentation**  
  - Work closely with software engineers to design resilient, scalable systems and provide feedback on code reliability and performance.
  - Document infrastructure configurations, deployment procedures, and operational processes to improve transparency and facilitate team onboarding.
  - Mentor junior team members in SRE best practices and contribute to fostering a culture of reliability and engineering excellence.
